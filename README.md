InstallerCraft
==============

A mod manager that lets you install and update mods in a few clicks, make and manage mod profiles, and much more.

In the code, it's actually known as "Minecraft Mod Manager." That's because I started working on the project before I resolved that I should name it "InstallerCraft." (One of my previous released batch files was also called InstallerCraft, so I was originally reluctant to use that name.)

Forking
-------

I intend to use the MIT License to let people fork this project and use it for other games like Kerbal Space Program that are also in need of a good mod manager.

If you are forking, I highly advise you license your repository under the MIT License as well so that I may ~~steal~~ pull any useful additions from your code.
